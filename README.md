### Kaki87

This project was created after a discussion with [Kaki87](https://kaki87.net), an awesome developer who taught me a lot of things. He had in mind to create this app but didn't have the time for it. I decided to learn Svelte and build it as a side project :)
This project would never have existed without him! 🙏
